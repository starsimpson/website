00:00:13 Bryan Cantrill: Welcome to On The Metal, Tales from the Hardware/Software Interface. I'm Bryan Cantrill. With me, as always, is Jess Frazelle. Hey, Jess.
00:00:20 Jessie Frazelle: Hey, Bryan.
00:00:21 Bryan: Joining us in the garage is our boss, Steve Tuck. Hey, Steve.
00:00:24 Steve Tuck: Glad to be here.
00:00:24 Bryan: Jess, do you want to introduce who we've got today?
00:00:27 Jessie: Today we have Star Simpson who is currently working on drones, but also has made boards in the past, given a lot of awesome talks on making custom boards and is just all over when it comes to the hardware/software interface.
00:00:41 Bryan: Star, welcome to the podcast. It is great to have you here.
00:00:44 Star Simpson: Thank you so much. Glad to be here.
00:00:45 Bryan: Star, I've got a bit of a confession. I feel this happened many times when you would have some incredibly interesting tweet, and I would tell Jess, "When are we getting Star on the podcast?" I know that we've been looking for you to join us for a long time. We're very, very happy that you could accommodate it with your schedule, so welcome.
00:01:05 Star: Oh my goodness, thank you. I was so flattered when you invited me.
00:01:08 Bryan: You described yourself as having a checkered past. You've been all over the map, so where should we take it from? You want to start from the beginning? How did you get into this stuff?
00:01:16 Star: Oh, goodness. I would say that I got started in hardware-- I don't know if this is a classic story or a precocious story. I was 14, I think. Actually, maybe let me back up. I remember the first time someone told me about programming. Let's start there. I was, I think, seven, eight or nine, something like that, at my first school. We would carpool. It was me and two other kids. One of the carpool parents was the school secretary, so she would come with us to school because she worked there also. She knew that I was super stoked on computers. My school was trying to be at the cutting edge, so they only bought Apple computers which was a huge expenditure, but they were really trying to do the best for us kids.
Unfortunately, in the '90s, Apple computers were like behind glass. You could bang on the glass, you couldn't really get into them. I would tinker with it and see what I could do. I remember on the drive to school one morning, this woman, she said to me, she's like, "I can tell you really like computers. I bet you'd like programming," and I was like, "What's programming?" She was like, "You know those programs you use," and I'm like, "Yes, I know the programs. I know Super Munchers. It's the best." She's like, "Programming is where you make the programs," and it was just galaxy brain, like,-
00:02:29 Bryan: Oh, wow.
00:02:29 Star: -"Oh my God, someone makes the software." This is actually how I got into hardware. I remember trying everything to understand how to do the programming because I wanted to make the programs, and I eventually ended up, I think, forgive me, pirating Borland Metrowerks C++ CodeWarrior-
00:02:51 Jessie: Nice.
00:02:51 Star: -for the Mac.
00:02:52 Bryan: Now, was that your next step from the carpool? You're actually--
00:02:56 Star: Actually, yes.
00:02:57 Bryan: Wow. That's a precocious child.
00:02:59 Star: There was no one around me to guide me--
00:03:00 Bryan: I would have jacked the C++ Compiler as my next step.
00:03:02 Star: I didn't now where to begin.
00:03:03 Bryan: That's great. Oh my God.
00:03:04 Star: That's what the internet told me to do. Because the internet at the time was like, "If you can't write a shell interpreter then are you even a programmer?" I was like, "I don't know. I'm nine."
[laughter]
Star: It seemed like that everything pointed me in that direction. I needed to get the thing to do the thing. I got the thing. Unfortunately, due to my ineptitude at pirating or whatever, it just didn't come with the standard I/O library. It came with a "Hello, World!" code example that wouldn't compile.
00:03:32 Bryan: Right, because you didn't have I/O streams. It was missing I/O streams.
00:03:35 Star: Exactly, so I was just like, "Wow. This is way harder than I though it would be. [chuckles] I don't know what to do." That's how I ended up bouncing off of coding initially and instead just keeping this burning fire under the surface of like, "I want to learn more about the computers. I don't know what to do. The C++ thing is inscrutable and a nightmare." Then a few years later, you can imagine, I'm still keeping my eye out, like, "I don't know how to do this. I really want to do it." I found a book on building your own circuits, and I was like, "There it is." I took that book, and I went to RadioShack. Somehow, this was-
00:04:12 Bryan: Oh, RadioShack.
00:04:12 Star: -more accessible.
00:04:13 Bryan: RIP RadioShack.
00:04:14 Star: RIP RadioShack. We paid an enormous sum of money, to me, at the time, a pre-teen with no cash on my own. I was like, "I can't believe my mom is spending this much money to buy a bunch of circuit components from RadioShack." I spent the entire summer just building every circuit example in the book.
00:04:29 Bryan: Oh, my gosh. Wow, that's great.
00:04:31 Star: It was my failure to get the code example to compile sent me directly into circuit design.
00:04:36 Bryan: I don't know what to think about C++ coming out of this. My going in thought is that you were abused as a child-
[laughter]
Bryan: -by C++. Now, that C++ actually drove you to hardware. That's great. Then getting excited about hardware, obviously, over that summer. Were you making burglar alarms?
00:04:56 Star: Yes, that kind of thing. The funny thing is, it gave me the strong impression initially that code was completely inscrutable, but hardware you could always get to the bottom of the problem. [chuckles]
00:05:07 Steve: Hardware's easy.
00:05:09 Bryan: It would have allowed you to probably completely understand what was in front of you. Clearly, you were, even at young age, someone who really wanted to understand things..
00:05:17 Star: I really wanted to understand things, yes.
00:05:18 Bryan: - at their root.
00:05:19 Star: Yes. The book, I think, it was 21 Transistor-- I remember the final thing was mind-blowingly cool to me which was a circuit that had memory. You could unplug it and plug it back in. The four LED state would be the same.
00:05:34 Bryan: Nice. It actually had persistence.
00:05:36 Star: It had persistence. I think I put two copper wires on the board, so it had a touch input to increment the LED count.
00:05:44 Bryan: That is great. Obviously, you felt a very deep resonance. Did you have an idea of what you wanted to go do at that point?
00:05:52 Star: I had a vague but strongly directional idea. I didn't know exactly what because, again, I was still roughly as informed as the kid who was, "The programming, I don't know where to begin. I'm just reading everything I can." Yes, I was really lucky to be able to get into things like robotics or building potato canons with my best friend in the summer, various stuff of varying levels of sophistication or lack thereof. [chuckles] It all really drove me to I knew I wanted to make stuff for people, that was going to be useful. I think that was the shape of my hope.
00:06:28 Bryan: It's that engineer's calling to actually build something that people would actually use. What next? Did you head off to school?
00:06:36 Star: I did. I went to MIT. I found out there were many levels of nerd.
[laughter]
Star: That was pretty cool also.
00:06:47 Bryan: Because you go in thinking like, "I am the nerdiest person I know." Then you get to the true of nerdom--
00:06:51 Star: I don't know if I thought that. I was actually quite intimidated before things even began. I was just like I know there are people out there that know about these things, and I want to know those people and I want to go explore.
00:07:03 Bryan: How did you get over that intimidation? Because I think that that's something that everybody feels where it's like, "Wow. Everyone is so much better." I've certainly felt that. I think most technologists have felt that at one point in time in their career or another.
00:07:14 Star: I think that there's a way of looking at things where you can either take a comparative and competitive view of the world, or you can take a collaborative view of the world or maybe you can take both, but I don't know about that one. I think that at some point, you just say, "Everyone who's wildly curious ends up knowing a whole lot about something, and this should be celebrated," is my approach.
00:07:35 Bryan: Yes, I just want to understand this. Jess engages, what I would call, competitive curiosity. You're very good at--
00:07:43 Jessie: Yes, it depends because--
00:07:46 Star: [laughs] No, it's cool, Jess. It's cool.
[laughter]
00:07:48 Jessie: It really depends.
[laughter]
The competitiveness, I think comes into play if I feel attacked.
00:07:55 Bryan: In other situations. Jess is a very competitive, very collaborative person.
00:08:01 Star: Don't get me wrong. I really love competitive atmospheres. I was a really fierce high school athlete also. I was a swimmer. There's totally a place for it, competitive spirit too. I think that insofar as it makes you feel intimidated, I think that it's okay to accept that being really into something, it doesn't necessarily mean anyone else also being really into that thing is harming you or taking [crosstalk]
00:08:27 Bryan: I think that that's it. I think that in some way, Jess, that's what you're great at. It's like, "Hey, I've discovered something great. I'm going to share it with everybody because I think it's interesting."
00:08:36 Jessie: I also think part of this podcast is finding those people who do the things, which is cool. Because I love anyone who is just really curious about a topic and goes super in-depth, I'm like, "I want to know what's going on in their brain."
00:08:51 Bryan: [chuckles] Speaking of topics in-depth, you have done a bunch with drones. I am really curious about how that started and when because you were working on the forefront?
00:09:02 Star: Oh, my gosh. Yes, it's a good question, I think. I don't know what exactly hit me, but I probably mark 2009 as me having developed an obsession with autonomous aircraft and started to think it about a lot then. I usually give people a few minutes head start to run before we bring this topic up, because--
00:09:18 Bryan: Oh, nice.
00:09:19 Jessie: Obviously.
00:09:21 Bryan: That's great. I know what that [crosstalk]
00:09:22 Steve: [crosstalk] in.
00:09:25 Bryan: Exactly. Wow. 2009, I'm trying to think of it in terms of the history of autonomous aircraft. That's early from an accessibility perspective, the terms of--
00:09:33 Star: Yes and no. For how we currently think about what we say drones, yes, but from the history of autonomous aircraft, no. Most people don't realize Marilyn Monroe actually worked in a drone factory during the war.
00:09:45 Bryan: Oh, interesting.
00:09:46 Star: Because this was just like radio-controlled target drones that the military were using at the time for target practice, whatever. She actually had a wartime job, which is assembling these things.
00:09:54 Bryan: Interesting? Wow.
00:09:54 Jessie: That's nuts.
00:09:56 Bryan: I feel that my first association with it is, is the military using them post 9/11 in Afghanistan?
00:10:03 Star: Oh, absolutely. That was a huge part of my inspiration because at the time, all of the headlines that included that word, drone, were pretty terrifying, fairly negative. I don't know why but my approach at the time being a college student, just being curious of where do ideas come from, how does technology work was to say that can't be the end of the story for this technology. I'm like, "What would I do? If I had a drone, I would do something different with it. What would I do? If I had autonomous aircraft what would I do?"
00:10:34 Bryan: That is so fundamentally optimistic, I think. I think this is a hallmark of technology, I think is optimism. I think as a society, we can be very pessimistic about technology. I think it's a good on you to realize that like, "Actually, we can do something different. This has got applications that are not merely in the military."
00:10:54 Star: It might and if it were to, what would those be? That started me thinking.
00:10:59 Bryan: Then where to from there?
00:11:01 Star: As mentioned, I was a college student, and college students are always hungry if nothing else. [chuckles] The answer to my question was I'd used it to bring food to myself.
[laughter]
00:11:11 Bryan: Nice.
00:11:13 Jessie: No, that's like a thing, I feel like.
00:11:15 Steve: Way away before your time.
00:11:17 Bryan: Yes. You were way from your time. Eating plays a central role in all three [crosstalk]
00:11:25 Star: Totally, totally. I can't think of a person for whom that's not true. [chuckles]
00:11:30 Bryan: You're like, "I am going to use this--"
00:11:31 Steve: Autonomous food delivery.
00:11:32 Star: That's a huge part of it. For me, I think the goal was to try and bring people into what I saw might be possible. I'd also say if you could have food brought to you right now-- This is a very relatable example that everyone could get on board with. I basically just started keeping notebooks of ideas of, "Here's what I would do if I had this autonomous aircraft." The one that I think I became known for, which is called the TacoCopter, and the theory that you can have a quadrotor bring you a taco to your location on demand. That's the one that really had traction. Even at the time, I would like to state for the record, I was thinking about what would be valuable price-per-pound of tacos that's fairly low.
[laughter]
Star: It caught people's attention.
00:12:15 Bryan: Look, you are more than just the TacoCopter.
00:12:19 Jessie: That's genius.
00:12:19 Bryan: It is genius.
00:12:20 Star: I'm not wearing a hoody right now. Now, I wish I was, so that I could pull the hood over my head.
[laughter]
00:12:25 Bryan: Where are quadcopters when you are starting to think about this?
00:12:28 Star: At the very bleeding edge. At the time, actually, I'm an undergrad. A few of my friends were aerodynamic students or more into the embedded systems. I remember one of them at great expense had written a letter to Atmel to get them to give us three accelerometers that were $100 each and hand-built a quadrotor. It was really lashed together. Now, you can buy kits. There's fairly good support for if you want to do this yourself, starting from scratch, writing the embedded system to control the thing. All of that.
00:13:04 Bryan: Could you educate us on that exactly? I know there's a lot of software involved, but I don't know what any of that software looks like. What are the key hardware components in the software? Stitch it together.
00:13:14 Star: Sure. That drone and a lot of drones, a lot of quadcopters are for electrically-controlled motors. An accelerometer, which basically measures the direction of gravity or G forces as you move. If you imagine a basic hover where it's just staying in place, it seeks to balance the current output through the motors, so that the position doesn't drift. Did that make any sense?
00:13:40 Bryan: Yes, that definitely made sense. The follow-up question is, because this is something has been my intuition, but I'd love to get the definitive answer. It seems to me that it is not really possible to build a quadcopter without software. Is that a fair statement?
00:13:53 Star: I would actually flip that statement and I would say that the quadcopter is really interesting, because if you know how to write software, it's one of the first flying things you can trivially control without having to get into aerodynamics or control or any of these light esoteric fields that have been developed for the last 50 years because it's symmetric aircraft. You can really naively say, "If it's tipped that way, bring the power up on this motor, bring the power down on the opposite one, and get it to hover or accept some constant velocity to get it to go in a particular direction." It's a really neat platform for allowing software to fly.
00:14:28 Bryan: Interesting.
00:14:29 Jessie: That's cool.
00:14:29 Bryan: Yes, that is really cool.
00:14:30 Jessie: Yes, because if it was a plane, you'd have to know how the wing dynamics and [crosstalk]
00:14:34 Star: What's an [unintelligible 00:14:34]. Yes, exactly.
00:14:36 Bryan: Right, you have to do a lot more physics, it sounds like. It seems to me that before the era of software avionics, some of the stuff would have been much more difficult or impossible.
00:14:49 Star: Yes. The quadcopter configuration, I think, would be pretty difficult for a human pilot. There have been very few experiments. There was one, the Piasecki PA 79 or 97, I can't remember, which was for-- I think, Huey helicopters in an airframe with a blimp. It [inaudible 00:15:12] You have four pilots, human beings on board trying to coordinate with each other. You would balance--
00:15:19 Jessie: That's nuts.
00:15:19 Star: It seems much better when it's just software.
00:15:22 Bryan: See, this is where I'm fundamentally a coward. I'm like, "You first in that thing. I'm not getting in that thing."
00:15:26 Jessie: I would do it. That sounds cool.
00:15:28 Bryan: See, this is the same--
00:15:30 Star: Spoiler alert, that was not a good aircraft to get into.
[laughter]
00:15:33 Steve: It didn't end well.
00:15:34 Bryan: Jess just wanted to rent a scissor lift for the office to drive around the office.
00:15:38 Steve: We tried to talk her down multiple times.
00:15:39 Bryan: Steve and I are a little--
00:15:40 Jessie: Why are we bringing this up? You already said that I did it.
00:15:43 Steve: Just trying to be courageous, that's all.
00:15:44 Bryan: I just know that this urge is bubbling underneath the surface.
00:15:47 Jessie: Yes, I know. I'll try anything once, basically. [chuckles]
00:15:50 Steve: Except a scissor lift.
00:15:51 Jessie: Yes, only because I'm not allowed.
00:15:54 Bryan: This is basically beyond the control of humans to reasonably fly, I would assume. Humans can't react, I assume, or maybe not.
00:16:01 Star: I'm not going to say it's impossible, but I think that there are certain controls tasks that people are better suited for and certain controls tasks that software would be better or software in the loop, if nothing.
00:16:13 Bryan: You're building the TacoCopter. How did that go? You're talking to your [crosstalk]?
00:16:18 Star: It's a funny story. The TacoCopter is one that sometimes I still get a little bit of negative feedback for because there's a lot involved, let me put it this way. As I do, I got really interested in this world to the point of complete obsession. I'm fresh off the back of my teenage Star Wars obsession, so I didn't know how to not talk about something that I was obsessed with. It got to the point that I got invited to a party I think was in San Francisco for some reason, and I just wouldn't stop talking about drones and how they were going to be a super important part of the future at this party until the host was like, "Everyone's good. No one wants to hear any more about drones."
00:17:03 Jessie: Why not? I would be like, "Listen, this is a messed up party." If it was any other party, I'd be like, "I want to talk to that person."
00:17:10 Steve: People are reporting to the host to take the drone talk down?
00:17:13 Bryan: People are escalating to the host? Come on.
00:17:15 Star: This is actually an important part of the story. Then the host of the party, he had taken me aside, and he was like, "Just a thought, why don't you make a website for your concept?" I was like, "Oh, brilliant. That's a great idea," so I made a website for the TacoCopter. That was all that happened. Basically, it was a text-only website. I really thought that the idea to make a website was brilliant for a specific reason which is I'm a college student. I don't have a ton of cash, but I had to pay for the domain. I knew the domain was going to expire every year, and I was really worried that I was going to forget about the idea of using autonomous aircraft to do stuff.
I didn't want to lose it and so I figured if every year the domain renewal would be a nudge of is this an idea whose time has arrived yet, which is why I made the website. It's really crucial to establish that this was not something to try and get the world's attention or anything, which is what ended up happening. The website pretty much just sat there, nothing happened, there was nothing on it. Then like a year-ish later, I want to say 2010, maybe 2011, something like that, I was like, "I should spruce up that old TacoCopter website, just beautify it. Here's the fun backstory. Probably, 10, 20 of my friends, something like that, a very close group of people had seen or heard of this website.
One of my friends who's just like, he's constantly trying to-- He's a schemer. He's like, "Oh, I'm getting points for my Hacker News account," whatever. It turns out, and I learned all of this in retrospect, he had made a new Hacker News account, and he wanted it to get a lot of karma points or whatever. A catering company, like a YC-funded catering company launched, super serious launch announcement like, "Oh, we're delivering lunch now for companies." This guy goes on there and just like smart comment, he's just like, "Oh, yes, that's cool. Whatever, it's too bad the TacoCopter isn't delivering yet." He posted the link to my page out of my notebook knowing this is not for anybody website.
00:19:24 Bryan: This is to remind you every year to contemplate whether this idea- [crosstalk]
00:19:27 Star: Yes. I realized this is very unusual to use the internet in this whole--
00:19:32 Bryan: You know what, it feels very close to home. [crosstalk]
00:19:35 Jessie: I like it.
00:19:36 Star: Nonetheless, I had done it. He posted this. Then someone else saw the link, and was like, "Oh my gosh, this is so awesome." This website, I promise you, it looked like a complete joke, there was animations going everywhere, it was cartoony, and all the colors--
00:19:54 Bryan: Next thing you know, you got four term sheets [crosstalk]
00:19:57 Star: Yes, there was even a little banner in the bottom because I also had bought LobsterCopter. Because it was in Boston at the time, and so I was like,-
00:20:05 Jessie: That's good.
00:20:06 Star: -"LobsterCopter is like tacos of the East." [chuckles]
00:20:09 Bryan: LobsterCopter. That's an interesting choice of [crosstalk]-
00:20:12 Jessie: That's really good.
00:20:13 Bryan: -I like it.
00:20:14 Star: Then someone took the link and posted it to the main Hacker News, and this was around, I want to say, a weekday night. This clearly hilarious website was people were starting to email it to each other because in 2011 it was not--
00:20:28 Bryan: In all the website you said it's a page of your notebook. This is just a sketch of what this thing would look like.
00:20:33 Star: A bookmark for an idea.
00:20:34 Bryan: Got it, okay.
00:20:35 Star: That's how he was treating it. People start to email each other this link. It turned out like my best friend from high school had professionally gone into super high volume, high-traffic website hosting. I was like, "Oh my gosh, I don't know what's happening." I didn't know where the traffic was coming from at the time. I actually just knew it had picked up an interest because I was in a weird time zone and the signup form was tied directly to my email. It was also my birthday and I got 10,000
00:21:00 Star: emails. "Someone's messing with me," something's happening. I don't know what.
00:21:05 Bryan: [crosstalk] you had a sign up on there to say--
00:21:06 Star: Oh, yes.Like, "If you're interested--"
00:21:08 Bryan: If you're interested. 10,000 people were interested.
00:21:12 Star: I was like, "Oh my gosh, I don't know what's happening, but this is getting a lot of traffic." He said, and this was a huge critical part, he's like, "You know, I think this idea is really important. I really liked this idea. Do you mind if I stand something up with like varnish or whatever, it's more likely to stand up to all the traffic you seem to be about to get." I was like, "Yes, sure, go for it, whatever." He basically put a super simple, bootstrappy website up, which, for better or for worse, had all of the look of basically a start-up--
00:21:40 Bryan: Legit, that looks legit.
00:21:41 Star: Yes. Instead of my total cartoon sketch nightmare, it looked like a standard bootstrap website. The other thing that happened because I was in a weird time zone, and he was just flying through this at the nighttime. The next morning when everyone checked their emails, because their friend had sent them this joke link, they saw it as super-serious thing. Maybe PR marketing professional could have predicted how this is gonna go, but I had no idea. Then the TacoCopter was a big news story, and ended up on The Colbert Report.
00:22:16 Bryan: Oh my gosh.
00:22:17 Jessie: Woah, that's nuts.
00:22:18 Bryan: That is amazing.
00:22:19 Star: I really didn't expect it. I was traveling myself. It was all completely--
00:22:24 Bryan: Several YC-funded companies [inaudible 00:22:26] They knew they couldn't compete.
00:22:28 Star: Started, actually, then-- [chuckles]
00:22:31 Jessie: Wait, it's all Hacker News, it's like a patient zero--
00:22:35 Star: Patient zero, yes, my friend and his throwaway account.
00:22:39 Bryan: You've must've been like-- look, this was like a bit of a not quite a joke, but this was some early ideation.
00:22:48 Star: I think it also registered a bunch of others. I'd registered DocuCopter on the theory that you'd want to quickly schlep around, legal documents or things with actual value because people for years--
00:23:00 Bryan: DocuCopter. I had no idea. There you go.
00:23:02 Star: I also had HemaCopter on the medical.
00:23:06 Bryan: You just went on a bender for the--
00:23:08 Star: I was buying up [crosstalk]
00:23:10 Jessie: DogCopter should be a TLD. [laughs]
00:23:12 Bryan: That's true.
00:23:13 Star: Are we ready for that? That's how that all went. I think there's a part of me that still feels like I need to defend. It wasn't really intended as a joke. It's something I really strongly believe in.
00:23:25 Bryan: It was early.
00:23:27 Star: It wasn't quite intended for the world.
00:23:29 Bryan: It was early ideation.
00:23:30 Star: That happened.
00:23:30 Jessie: That's really cool.
00:23:31 Bryan: I also feel that, and I'm sure you got this, it's very annoying when people are so critical of early ideation, where it's like, "Why haven't you built this thing yet?" It's like because it's an early idea.
00:23:41 Star: We had. We've messed around with-- a friend of mine, he was super into building drones, so we hung grocery bags full of tacos, and flew them around.
00:23:51 Bryan: This was further along, this is more than just a page in the notebook then, you actually built the thing.
00:23:55 Star: We had experimented and explored it, but I think that there were a lot of things technologically in terms of public acceptance of the idea, regulation. More so than now there were no rules governing whether you could do this or not, it just seemed like-- I was actually really very conservative about that whole out thing. I think there's a quote I gave at the time, and I'm proud of it. I think I was 22 or 23, I was like, "It's not unreasonable to regulate this because there are some risks."
00:24:25 Bryan: Oh, now you just capitalized another YC company.
[laughter]
00:24:28 Star: Oh goodness, we looked into it, it's not that we hadn't. Then at the same time, people were like, "How much is really there? We didn't have it incorporated or anything, it was like working on some other thing. It ended up exploding and then collapsing. I think it was actually wired, ran like a hit piece at the end of a week of, "What is happening?" Media coverage. It was like, "It's a hoax." I was was like--
00:24:54 Jessie: What? How dare they?
00:24:56 Star: [chuckles] I was like, "Who are all you people and why are you in my yard?"
00:25:04 Bryan: This wasn't even supposed to be here, I was supposed to come to work today.
00:25:06 Steve: [crosstalk]
00:25:08 Bryan: Is that where it ended up? Is it with the wired hippies? Was that the quota for the TacoCopter?
00:43:13 Star: Roughly speaking, yes, because I was still working on some other project. I think that is, as you mentioned, about when a bunch of current drone companies launched, it was a few months after that a bunch of bigger tech corporations announced their quadcopter based initiative.
00:25:30 Bryan: They need to talk a copter response clearly.
00:25:32 Steve: They have the host of a party to thank.
00:43:34 Star: It's also predictable now. [chuckles]
00:25:37 Bryan: That's great, what were you building at the time? What did that inspire [crosstalk]
00:25:40 Star: Oh gosh.I was working on something completely unrelated that in retrospect was never going to be a really easy business to start, but I had done some work in college on a project in my own free time to make electronic components on the idea that I could make electricity more legible or easier to understand. Anyway, it was one of a couple of things I ended up going off to try and start and was working on at the time.
00:26:08 Bryan: That's great. What was after that? What came next?
00:26:12 Star: Roughly nothing relevant for a little while I was just doing electrical engineering stuff and getting more in my job, understanding manufacturing better. For a couple years, I think I was doing electronic circuit design, and then working on getting some other things shipped later at another company. I still thought the TacoCopter or autonomous aircraft potential was pretty exciting, but the regulatory environment was just too weird and unsettled that I didn't want to take my career in that direction at the time.
00:26:44 Bryan: Interesting. Then so what changed?
00:26:46 Star: We have drone regulations now. Really, honestly, is your podcast like a regulations podcast?
[laughter]
00:26:54 Bryan: No, but we are nerds, and we will go deep on anything.
00:26:57 Jessie: Also, when did the regulation pass and why? What made people woke?
00:27:03 Star: I remember very clearly there was a congressional mandate to write drone regulations that was supposed to pass, I think, in September of 2015. Date came and went. Something came out of it for a while. There was an exemption called Section 333, which is where you can be like, "I am a very serious oil and gas company, and we'd like to use this cutting edge technology to inspect our such and such," and you'd get these one-off approvals. A lot of people went into data collection, which is aka taking photos with drones just for the purpose of getting the exemption for whatever the early photographing real estate companies.
Then after that, we got the rule that we have now, which is the US FAA's Part 107, which actually created a provision that allows you to fly commercially and collect money for your work. Which before that, was just a gray area. I think that was 2017. All of that's coming together.
00:27:51 Bryan: What does that allow you to do? If you've got a drone, what can you do with it? What kind of businesses can you build on autonomous aircraft?
00:27:58 Star: You can fly no higher than 400 feet above the ground. Oh, sorry, not above ground, above the surface, which includes above the top of the structure. You can fly within visual line of sight, and you are allowed to get paid for your work. You may not fly over people who haven't given consent.
00:28:18 Jessie: Oh, because photos, right?
00:28:20 Star: Right. Yes, largely the work is photos. I'm pretty sure it's pretty explicit, still you may not move any cargo for hire just the same.
00:28:28 Bryan: All right. Cargo.
00:28:30 Jessie: Those being legal documents or serving people, that would not work?
00:28:35 Star: Yes.
00:28:35 Jessie: That's a bummer.
00:28:35 Bryan: We may not classify the lobster as cargo.
00:28:39 Jessie: Yes. It's a passenger.
00:28:40 Star: I strongly advise against trying to skirt FAA regulations.
[laughter]
00:28:46 Bryan: Were you working with regulatory bodies to try to figure out what the right way to regulate this was? There were other folks in the industry that are trying to figure all this out?
00:28:53 Star: Yes, and it's an ongoing conversation.
00:28:55 Bryan: You know what, I think it's interesting that even as a young person you were accepting the need for regulation. What's it like as a technologist to have to go deal with regulation?
00:29:05 Star: I think this is a very interesting question. I originally, because I got into the circuits thing, I think it was very clear to me that best practices are a thing to know about. I just felt like early on when I was young that there ought to be something that I didn't know how it worked yet. Maybe I was a little timid at the time, but that was my outlook was informed by the professional standards of more the electrical engineering side.
00:29:29 Bryan: That there should be a prescribed best practice, there should be a prescribed way to do things better.
00:29:35 Star: Yes. I think that that was my sense, my understanding, my outlook of how the world worked.
00:29:39 Bryan: That's great. It's very enlightened, especially for--
00:29:43 Star: [unintelligible 00:29:43] I cannot accept that adjective.
00:29:47 Bryan: You often come to that, the hard way.
00:29:50 Jessie: From learning the lesson of whatever it was that needed to be [inaudible 00:29:52]
00:29:53 Star: If you knew me as a little kid, you would know I learned a lot of lessons the hard way.
00:29:57 Bryan: We want to hear more about those. We're going to take a quick break. We will be right back with more Star Simpson On The Metal.
[music]
00:30:06 Steve: On The Metal is brought to you by the Oxide Computer Company. Bad news. I just got back from a meeting with the attorneys. Oh, boy. They are not going to let us say much in these ads. We can't talk about the customer experience today for on-premises infrastructure.
00:30:21 Jessie: We can't do my idea to be like, "Are you being gaslighted by your vendors?" Because that's what they're doing. They are gaslighting people into thinking that these bugs only exist on one of their machines when it exists on everyone's.
00:30:32 Steve: God, no. They called that I think "a third rail."
00:30:35 Bryan: They must be following Jess on Twitter. I knew that that was a bad idea to let the lawyers follow Jess on Twitter.
00:30:39 Steve: They also said we can't talk about public cloud customer experience.
00:30:43 Bryan: Oh, come on, we can't talk about the rapacious bandwidth pricing, it's practically criminal.
00:30:47 Steve: No, we can't talk about the unit economics of that at all.
00:30:49 Bryan: Can we use the word criminal with respect to public cloud vendors?
00:30:52 Steve: Definitely not.
00:30:52 Bryan: Oh, boy, what can we do?
00:30:54 Steve: They gave us a statement we can use which is-
00:30:58 Bryan: Are you going to read from it?
00:30:58 Steve: -Oxide Computer Company is building something that should help some people.
00:31:04 Bryan: Wow, that seems very direct. Come on, can we at least send them over to oxide.computer?
00:31:08 Steve: We can. The other bit of bad news is all the lawyers were there in the meeting.
00:31:12 Bryan: Wait a minute. Not just the cheap one but the expensive one?
00:31:15 Steve: Yes, they're all there.
00:31:16 Bryan: We paid a fortune to get this terrible ad. Oh my God, please, listener, go to oxide.computer and learn what we're actually doing. All right, we're back. We're talking about lessons learned the hard way that we love lessons- learned the hard way. What are some of the lessons you learned the hard way?
00:31:33 Star: [chuckles] No parent gets a guide to parenting. If you were to be able to write one for me in retrospect, it would include don't tell me, Star, don't tell little Star not to mix electricity and water and not provide any explanation.
00:31:48 Jessie: Whoa, that's scary. [chuckles]
00:31:50 Star: Precisely.
00:31:51 Bryan: You lived [crosstalk]
00:31:53 Star: I did.
00:31:54 Jessie: [crosstalk]
00:31:54 Star: [laughs] Spoiler alert. [laughs]
00:31:57 Bryan: Spoiler alert, you're alive, so what happened?
00:31:59 Star: I did a bunch of things that were extremely dumb but largely did it having asked when told that-- I asked, "Why not?" I was just told, "Just don't do it." I remember collecting an enormous quantity of dead AA or C batteries actually. I think I remember harvesting them out of the stereo after [crosstalk] ran out. You have to picture this in your mind, picture this barrel battery, the alkaline battery format. It's a cylinder. If you want to make a circuit of batteries, so that you're going to connect two batteries, contacts to each other, and another one and another one, and you're just going to add a little bit of angle until it makes a big loop because I knew about the idea of circuits. There's a lot of batteries. A huge amount of batteries.
00:32:48 Jessie: Especially the few ones are very chunky.
00:32:50 Star: They're very chunky, yes. I collected enough that I could make a circle out of batteries just because it's a magic rune or something. The circle seems like an important shape.
00:33:01 Jessie: It's like a power wheel.
[00:33:02] Star: Exactly. I was like, "I've got to see what happens." I'd collected all these batteries, and I was laying them out on the carpet and making a little [unintelligible 00:33:08] in the carpet fabric to get the battery not to roll and all this. I was just a few battery lengths short of being able to complete it. I was like, "Oh, I'm so close. I'm going to get a conductive material, like a paper clip." I unbent a paper clip. I'm almost going to connect it. As soon as I'd connected that unbent paperclip wire across it, it glowed orange and white-hot, and I'm holding it between my little fingers. That happened.
00:33:39 Jessie: That is terrifying.
00:33:40 Bryan: I would assume you probably had 30c batteries.
00:33:44 Star: Something like that.
00:33:45 Bryan: That's got to be enough. It's definitely enough to start a fire.
00:33:47 Star: Nearly did, the batteries. It glowed, and then I threw the paperclip of course. Fortunately, I think the air was able to cool it before it hit the ground. Then my fingers had two stripes across them.
00:33:59 Steve: Secondary degree burns.
00:34:00 Star: Oh, yes.
00:34:02 Bryan: Now did you have the thought process of like, "Now, that would be a lot more fun with much bigger batteries"?
00:34:06 Star: My take was "Now, I know what happens on that one."
00:34:11 Bryan: God, that is such a great way. I feel like I never learned the lesson that easily. I've always got to be like, "All right, let's make it much bigger."
00:34:17 Star: It was not the only one. It was not the only time.
00:34:23 Steve: What next?
00:34:24 Star: A, in retrospect, I think, scary one, dumb one that fortunately didn't turn out worse was I also knew that lightning was electricity. I remember my mom was like, "Lightning, metal, and water is bad." I was like, "What happens?" I remember taking our entire recycling out to the yard [laughs] and during a thunderstorm just standing around waiting to see what would happen.
00:34:47 Bryan: Time for somebody to explain the story how this thing works. Go inside.
00:34:49 Jessie: It needed a better explanation.
00:34:51 Bryan: You did need a better explanation. I agree.
00:34:53 Jessie: You need to know why.
00:34:54 Star: I did need to know why. I needed to know why. I was so disappointed that nothing happened.
00:35:00 Jessie: Thank God nothing happened.
00:35:02 Star: I'm so sorry to my mom.
[laughter]
00:35:04 Bryan: Yes. We're all-
00:35:05 Star: To be clear, I was like six.
00:35:08 Steve: Now, I'm much more appreciative of your plush electronics learning set.
00:35:12 Star: This is a real problem in people's lives that I was trying to solve.
[laughter]
00:35:16 Steve: I saw that, so Canidu.
00:35:19 Star: That's the name of the company we made to be a kit for learning about electronics.
00:35:25 Steve: It looked really interesting.
00:35:26 Star: Thank you.
00:35:26 Steve: Certainly with kids that are under the age of six, much more predisposed to trying to get those in their hands versus all the batteries starting to disappear in the house.
00:35:35 Star: [chuckles] Yes. I had a bunch of theories about why it would be good to make large directly representational objects that could let you tinker. I was also definitely scratching a very fresh itch of my own. I'm glad that didn't turn out worse. It was the right way to do this. How old are your kids?
00:35:51 Steve: Two, three, and five.
00:35:52 Star: Oh my goodness.
00:35:53 Steve: The five-year-old's starting to get excited about electronics.
00:35:56 Star: Oh, nice. It's a very pleasing ages from [unintelligible 00:35:58] perspective.
00:36:00 Jessie: [laughs] Yes, that's true.
00:36:01 Bryan: It's true. It's true. Steve fortunately does not have two one-year-olds to go with it. That's what he would need. I think that the five-year old, I think, could be safe, be trusted with electronics. [unintelligible 00:36:13]
00:36:14 Steve: She got her first set, stared to play around with taking a battery, getting a loop created, getting a wheel flying and-
00:36:20 Star: Oh, that's awesome.
00:36:20 Steve: -little pinwheel. Her first starter set.
00:36:24 Star: Way more useful than just like straight [unintelligible 00:36:25]  though a paper clip. [chuckles]
00:36:28 Steve: Yes, I might have connected a circuit with a paper clip myself back in the day, saw the same white hot reaction.
00:36:34 Bryan: I recall, as playing with a paper clip, it's around the outlet that gets the [crosstalk] care.
00:36:38 Steve: That's what I did. Yes, exactly. That's the one that--
00:36:40 Bryan: just make sure they're in the same hand, so you don't have it two hands. Keep one hand in your pocket, as my father's fond of saying.
00:36:46 Star: I'm really jealous of kids who can look up what happens when you mix electricity with various things on YouTube now. If any kids are listening to this, it's a whole other world.
00:36:55 Bryan: It is, but then they want to replicate it. They want to-
00:36:58 Jessie: That didn't stop me from wanting to do the scissor lift thing.
00:37:01 Steve: I was just going to say because you didn't look up scissor lift accidents.
00:37:04 Jessie: I looked up tutorials.
00:37:05 Steve: Yes.
00:37:06 Bryan: Yes, you need to google accidents, and then your disposition changes a little bit. In terms of learning lessons as an engineer when you were further along in terms of with aeronautical software, with avionics, obviously the failure modes are much more acute or can be. How do you deal with those kinds of problems and making sure that-- I'm sure you've had some horror stories.
00:37:26 Star: I actually don't have horror stories. I think that safety-critical engineering is a really good topic that I'm glad to live in an era where a lot of people have made a lot of discoveries, and there are good lessons available to be learned. I'm also a full-scale glider pilot now, so I fly planes that don't have engines. Which, pretty esoteric hobby, but a really rewarding-- it's like a really beautiful way to go experience, nature.
00:37:49 Bryan: It must me amazing, it must be so quiet.
00:37:52 Star: Yes, but it's brought me into contact with talking to other people in aviation, and there's a lot of effort put in to understanding what goes wrong, why things go wrong and how to medicate those things.
00:38:05 Bryan: I just got to ask you, 737 MAX, what your take is. It's such an interesting fiasco. How does one avoid in developing one's own software? I'd say as a software engineer, I look at the 737 MAX, and I'm like I feel that this is like a move fast, break things culture infecting an aircraft company, which is a very bad idea.
00:38:29 Star: I'm not sure about that. I'm actually slightly reticent to comment on the MAX specifically, because I feel that I may be one among the peanut gallery, I couldn't have as much information--
00:38:38 Bryan: Oh, we're all at the peanut gallery at this, aren't we?
00:38:41 Star: Fair enough.
00:38:41 Bryan: I feel like that doesn't stop me anyway.
00:38:45 Star: Fair enough. I think it's obviously an enormous tragedy, and I can't really feel anything besides completely heartbroken that it happened, and I think that pretty intense lessons have been learned that I hope will continue to impact the world of aviation where people's travel are in the hands of the people doing the engineering. I know it will, it already has.
00:39:09 Bryan: I think the irony is that when we first started using software in safety critical roles, there was a lot of concern that we would have software-related defects that would cause loss of life. It basically wasn't true for a long time. There was the Airbus crash at the Paris Air Show, but there basically was not a lot of software, software was not at root for loss of life, loss of property. It's interesting and, as you say, tragic that when we really should know much better, software has begun to emerge as a failure mode here. It's obviously much more complicated than software, there's a whole bunch of things that broke down there.
00:39:51 Star: One thing I do see here is that we are at the cusp of a new era in aviation, I think, where we've been increasing the level of classic automation, which are tools to reduce pilot workload, which is making things slightly more automated or having slightly more software involved. I think that, so too, as we're seeing a lot of debate about how to roll out maybe self-driving vehicles elsewhere, I think that there's a level of autonomy in flying gadgets that I want to see the opportunity to field in test and field in use in a risk mitigated way. I think we actually need to do more work.
00:40:38 Bryan: Absolutely. Because it's not happening right now in vehicle, certainly.
00:40:42 Star: Is that so? I'm not familiar.
00:40:43 Bryan: From my perspective, the fact that you've got this thing that is called an autopilot that is clearly not an autopilot.
00:40:49 Star: I must be in a bubble because all I hear about is like how to deal with the safety-critical factors.
00:40:54 Bryan: No, I think the just in terms of the Tesla autopilot. Tesla autopilot is not an autopilot.
00:40:58 Jessie: It is actually really good, having like ridden in one, it's really good.
00:41:00 Star: I don't know so much about that.
00:41:02 Bryan: The problem is it's not an autopilot.
00:41:04 Jessie: Fair, fair.
00:41:05 Steve: It's a pilot assist.
00:41:06 Jessie: Autopilot being something where you can just go to sleep-
00:41:10 Bryan: It is not [crosstalk]--
00:41:10 Jessie: -and it does--
00:41:10 Bryan: Yes, exactly. It's not self-driving. If you read all the fine print, it's not self-driving. You call it an autopilot.
00:41:16 Star: I'm really into bicycle, so please, all of you don't sleep in your car while it's moving.
00:41:21 Steve: Right. Don't play video games, and don't read newspapers. I think the use case that people appreciate about it is when they're in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and the vehicle will actually move forward and stop.
00:41:35 Star: Can we move to a clean sheet view of here's what I want. I'm into the idea of autonomy in vehicles, but I don't think I really need it to get me around town. The place I want it, because I live in LA and I've come up to the Bay Area, I've driven a few times, I just want a tractor front-end that I can attach to my car that's just going to take me up I-5. It doesn't need to do anything, no turns, doesn't need anything specific. I just want the long haul to be.--
00:42:00 Bryan: The long-haul makes so much more sense. There's a romantic allure to replacing humans. We want to replace them everywhere. Yes, it's the long haul up I-5, and that's also where you can commercially, for commercial trucking, you actually don't want someone who's sleep-deprived at the wheel. It makes a lot of sense.
00:42:21 Jessie: Plus there's less factors like bicyclists, humans crossing the street, whatever.
00:42:24 Steve: You're back to sleeping in the cab.
00:42:26 Bryan: There you could actually solve the problem. You could solve the problem from the grapevine to [unintelligible 00:42:30] You can solve that problem. That feels--
00:42:35 Steve: That is where autonomous trucking, a lot of the [crosstalk] are right now.
00:42:38 Bryan: It is. I feel like we are not culturally focusing on that case enough.
00:42:42 Star: It came to mind as one where I think it would be a pretty direct hit in terms of convenience in my life and one that I'd be pretty into. I don't even care if it's my car with its wheels on the road. Put me on one of those the truck that carries all the [crosstalk] Maybe those ultimately devolves a little bit into being like a train. I'd get off the car. [crosstalk] They have these semis that get linked up into these really long assemblies in Western Australia where there're not a lot of people or road hazards, they call it truck trains. You could have a car for the people and then the car for the cars.
00:43:18 Bryan: This is a really interesting point that you're making about meeting the world where it is as opposed to demanding that one changed the world around [unintelligible 00:43:27] innovation. What you're basically saying is, "Look, we don't need to replace humanity for all personal transportations."
00:43:34 Star: I don't know if we are or aren't. I can't make a strong statement about that.
00:43:37 Bryan: Let's just see how we can make the world-- how we can improve it, as opposed to--
00:43:43 Star: Yes. I think you called me an optimist earlier, but I think I'm a bit of an optimizer.
00:43:48 Jessie: [laughs] That's good.
00:43:49 Star: What's the word, kind of exhausting. This thing could be slightly better in this one particular way. People are like, "Star, it's fine, it works. Move on."
00:43:59 Bryan: Surely you've got some stories or some things that you obsessively optimized when everyone else thought it was good enough.
00:44:05 Jessie: We love optimizing.
[laughter]
00:44:07 Bryan: Jess will definitely want to hear some if--
00:44:09 Star: I'm going to throw this out there in the category of things that were too much work but that were an awesome vision. I remember once, I thought I was going to get really into drafting, which is a particular type of drawing that you draw 3D objects with perspective as they are. In order to practice my drafting skills, because I was on a kick at the time about transparent faces, I sat in my kitchen, and I drew drawings of the contents of every cabinet, and I put those drawings on the front of the cabinet so that you could see what was in the-- It was like a tangible label with no text, nationalized by default. It was really ridiculous, but people were like "Yes."
00:44:50 Steve: The first see through refrigerator door.
00:44:52 Star: Yes. It was like you could've just used glass, but I'd press people. I'd be like, "Is it better?" They're like "Yes, sure."
[laughter]
00:44:59 Bryan: That is great.
00:44:59 Star: That's a total over-optimization.
00:45:02 Bryan: I can see that when people walk in, you'd be like, "Look at this. Isn't this amazing?" People are like, "Is everything okay?"
[laughter]
00:45:09 Star: No, I don't have to give you a rundown on how the kitchen works, you can see for yourself, you don't have to search through drawers.
00:45:15 Bryan: That is great. I think taking a fresh approach is so important for so many of these of these problems.
00:45:21 Star: I think I maybe have learned to tone down or focus my targets a little better.
00:45:26 Jessie: I feel like toning down should not happen.
00:45:29 Bryan: I agree. I think that if you got to--
00:45:30 Star: You can't [unintelligible 00:45:31] to say, "It's fine, it's okay, the kitchen is fine," [crosstalk]
00:45:36 Jessie: For someone who has meticulously labeled every single cable that I own.
00:45:40 Star: Cables are really worth labeling, I totally agree.
00:45:44 Jessie: It's worth going above and beyond.
00:45:46 Star: I'm just saying having the impulse and tying it to looking for something where you're going to get a good reward for the [crosstalk], that's my new thing.
00:45:54 Bryan: I think that that you should actually cultivate that that kind of obsessiveness. I think especially as one gets older, you temper that with wisdom, but that obsessiveness is great. That's such an emotional power.
00:46:06 Star: Can you learn a lesson about obsessiveness here? There are positive targets that other people here have trained their obsession on.
00:46:14 Bryan: I feel like Jess, very positively, is obsessive.
00:46:17 Jessie: There is no shame when it comes to labeling tables-
00:46:21 Bryan: Yes, no shame.
00:46:23 Jessie: -or organizing other shit.
00:46:26 Bryan: I think it's such terrific to appreciate the results of that.
00:46:30 Jessie: I'm also practical when it comes to other people not appreciating it. I'll appreciate it, but other people don't have to. I might [crosstalk] on you all at times.
00:46:40 Star: I got to say, I'm surprised that more people don't use more checklists in everyday life. You guys are all just stunned right now.
00:46:48 Bryan: No, no.
00:46:49 Steve: No, I was just reflecting on I use checklists for checklists, which is not very useful if-
00:46:53 Star: Wait, how does that work?
00:46:54 Steve: -they don't get to the end result of getting through the checklist of the checklist.
00:46:57 Star: You use the checklists for checklist. Did we do the ex checklist?
00:47:01 Steve: Then I just need to execute on the first checklist.
00:47:04 Jessie: I don't know how people survive without checklists, actually.
00:47:07 Bryan: I'm a big checklist person. It's nice because it feels like you need that positive reward that you're making progress, especially when you're working on a hard problem. How do you use checklists?
00:47:16 Star: I don't mean to-do lists, I mean for simple stuff.
00:47:19 Steve: Fair enough. Because I was thinking my to-do list for to-do list.
00:47:22 Bryan: You're talking in the aviation sense of actually making sure the flaps are down.
00:47:26 Star: Yes, that type of checklist.
00:47:29 Bryan: Absolutely. Expand on that, because I totally agree.
00:47:32 Star: I think probably the first one I really did was packing checklists, if I traveled and I was like, "I really wish I had whatever," then I actually kept running checklists for stuff like that.
00:47:43 Bryan: I totally agree. Early in my career, I felt frustrated that people would we had the operating system, people would break the operating system for preventable reasons. It's like, "Why do we not have a checklist that has 45 things on it and you've got to go check them all off before you actually integrate.
00:48:03 Star: Break that down for me, what do you mean "break the operating system"?
00:48:06 Bryan: With any complicated body of software there's obviously lots of things that you have to remember. Lots of things you have to keep track of, "Did you test this? Did you test that? Did you test this other thing? Have you thought about the ramifications of this or that?" A lot of that just felt like it was exhaustive. There was just too much to remember but a lot of it was knowable. We can know this list and we can enumerate it.
00:48:28 Star: You can. Yes, so this is like software tests now.
00:48:30 Bryan: If you can know it and you can enumerate it, one, you should automate it but even when you've got a human in the loop and you do, when you're integrating software, you have a human in the loop. A human is deciding like, "It is time to integrate the software." Yes, you want to automate that to support it but you need to know and that's how I view checklists.
00:48:49 Star: Do you actively regard tests as checklists?
00:48:51 Jessie: It could be.
00:48:52 Bryan: Yes, I think it depends on-- Yes, would you? We ask the questions around here.
[laughter]
00:48:59 Star: Does this table not turn?
[laughter]
I think, in terms of accumulating data about easy, preventable, simple mistakes, I really, really, really love procedural things to go through to see if you've done the right thing. One thing I'm really proud of actually, we use checklists really heavily at the company, everything from before take-off to even just building the aircraft. We just got through a building, finally, we've learned enough about doing this like put it together and turned it on and no fiddling. No like, "Oh, is this like left or right or does this go up or down?" and you're just like, "No, I followed the instructions. We turned it on and it worked." and I'm so proud.
00:49:44 Bryan: That is great. Can you talk about the technical details, so what is your current company? What do you guys currently building? Yes, talk about the technical details of that because I think that's a very important lesson.
00:49:51 Star: We build autonomous aircraft with the goal of forwarding goods and equipment, cargo, strictly with nobody on board.
00:49:58 Jessie: That's cool.
00:50:00 Bryan: This is the vision you've had for a long time coming to a real fruition.
00:50:05 Star: It's one of them but it's the result of a lot more in-depth thought about what's valuable in aviation, what do aircraft-- what jobs do they have? Looking at the object as having its own role that people find valuable to do and then looking at the edges and saying, "What aren't we doing right now because we can't," because that changes when you go autonomous.
00:50:26 Bryan: Interesting. What are some of the things that you've found in terms of some of those opportunities?
00:50:31 Star: The best way to model what we're doing is, we're supporting additional operations that users who would otherwise interact with helicopters for moving cargo payloads might want done in a more efficient way.
00:50:46 Bryan: You're building the aircraft to do that as well?
00:50:48 Star: We are, yes.
00:50:48 Bryan: That's exciting.
00:50:49 Star: It's really the easiest way to prove out what we're doing.
00:50:53 Bryan: Describe in terms of, as you were developing the checklists and developing the platform for that, what were some of the engineering challenges that you had.
00:51:02 Star: Oh, I mean, so this is actually not uncommon in a first build of an aircraft where you have aerodynamic control surfaces that have to go up or down depending on whether you want to turn left or right. For whatever reason, I find it pretty difficult to put myself in the reference frame to like, "Okay, this one's going up that means that the counter-reaction is this thing's going down, so that means like, and then like, okay, and then like, this way means turning that way." That's one of the ones where you have to get that right and just making a visual checklist for that saves so much effort with so much better than just trying to work it out in your head every time. Which is I think something that a checklist is exactly perfect for.
00:51:44 Bryan: Interesting.
00:51:44 Jessie: That makes a lot of sense because a lot of those are like-- Or at least those planes are super non-intuitive, it's the opposite that you would think it really is.
00:51:51 Star: It may not be intuitive and it's just a million times better not to say, I think I got it right. That's really cool.
00:51:58 Bryan: Obviously you guys, you're engaged in safety, critical engineering.
00:52:02 Star: Well, we are involved in doing engineering with things that fly, but because we don't fly over people, we don't fly with people on board, if we were to see it come down in test, that would probably just at best rumble the landing gear, not further damage other than something we could replace pretty easily.
00:52:24 Jessie: Oh, that's cool.
00:52:24 Bryan: But it's just your disposition though, is so strongly towards building safe things. I may just contrast you.
00:52:31 Star: Why not?
00:52:32 Bryan: I'm sitting here writing a bash script or whatever it's like you get the level of discipline is?
00:52:37 Star: I don't want a test to go badly for dumb reasons, basically.
00:52:40 Bryan: How do you prevent that? How do you have a culture that prevents that? A system that prevents that?
00:52:46 Star: I think that the phrase that I really love is to make haste slowly. This was a quote from we think a Roman military leader. It was like you want to go as quickly as you can without being hasty I think ultimately. When you make dumb mistakes, you don't check your work with something that's going to leave the surface of the earth. It's pretty easy to not find out what you were trying to find out or not get the thing to work correctly, as you hoped for simple reasons. I'm so frustrated, there's so much work that goes into building anything that like, I want to say like, "Okay, like this big thing was as we expected." Not like, "Well, who knows because left was right and right was left." It's a huge waste of time.
00:53:31 Jessie: Totally.
00:53:32 Bryan: How do you work up to that? So you know the big thing when it turns on it's going to turn on correctly. You've got to have a lot of small things that you test is also work.
00:53:40 Star: Yes, I would say this doesn't necessarily come naturally to me, but we have a pretty good practice of capturing and documenting and building up the docs to support that as we go and it just makes life so much better, so much more efficient. It lets us move so much more quickly.
00:53:56 Bryan: Have things well documented and communicated.
00:53:58 Star: Yes, so the first time we built it over, like, okay, this is what was tricky so next time that's clearly written about how to navigate this little, it narrows.
00:54:08 Bryan: Oh, interesting.
00:54:08 Jessie: That's cool.
00:54:10 Bryan: Is this in the spirit of technical documentation or more experiential documentation?
00:54:13 Star: It's for technical documentation. It's pack lists and it's checklists for actual procedure and checklists for what data we're recording if it needs to be manually recorded. I strive for this culture of efficient, I don't want to use the word bureaucracy, but like light touched. The procedure is meant to support getting the job done and no more.
00:54:36 Bryan: Right.
00:54:36 Jessie: Yes.
00:54:37 Bryan: You want to make haste slowly, as you say. You want to be sure that you're rigorous and you're still moving at pace.
00:54:44 Star: Rigorous is a great word.
00:54:45 Jessie: Yes, it's one of our values, rigor and urgency coming to tension.
00:54:49 Bryan: Rigor and urgency. Yes, so we've got 15 values at Oxide and we ask people to take two of our values and ask when they have come in the tension for them.
00:54:59 Jessie: The most common, is it correct?
00:55:00 Bryan: Rigor is one of our values.
00:55:01 Star: Rigor and urgency.
00:55:01 Jessie: It's is very [crosstalk].
00:55:02 Bryan: Urgency is another one of our values.
00:55:03 Star: Absolutely.
00:55:04 Bryan: I think rigor and urgency and the tension framework urgency. That's the tension that we see a lot in engineering. I mean, in how you do navigate that tension because you've got to be, I think in our belief, your belief obviously is that rigor has to win out.
00:55:16 Star: Yes, you don't want to miss steps and I think it's hard to do otherwise now that we have this practice.
00:55:24 Bryan: Right, well, in terms of like once you set a culture of that.
00:55:29 Jessie: Of documenting and logs.
00:55:31 Bryan: That people come in, we got one of our founding engineers, Robert Mustacchi, is a terrific note-taker in meetings. He's amazing.
00:55:41 Jessie: He makes me feel self-conscious.
00:55:43 Bryan: Can we just talk about that for a second-
00:55:44 Jessie: Great, that's awesome.
00:55:45 Bryan: Sorry to start. We're going to have a therapy session real quickly. I get total meeting imposter syndrome.
00:55:50 Steve: The bar has been set high.
00:55:51 Bryan: Bar has been set super high, but it's where in every meeting you take these notes that I then send them out to everyone and boy, it's amazing though, to have that and to have that culture get set and that expectation get set.
00:56:04 Star: I super appreciate that. I have the world of respect for people who note take at that level. We make it work, but when you don't have people who necessarily process naturals, how do you do it?
00:56:14 Bryan: Yes, how do you it?
00:56:15 Star: Or how do you make it lightweight? One thing we do that I think has been really good for us capturing and remember. The hardest thing to do for us, it's like you go out and we actually field test with a real prototype and you can say like, "Well, I think what I saw was this. I think this is the thing we need to adjust for next time." You leave the field, you go to the office and you're like, "Okay, here's what I saw and here's it--" and that might shift as you go from the in situ moment to later trying to remember what the other guy said looked like it needed to be adjusted.
We do post-flight debrief where we just do a huddle and talk through, what did you see? How did it go? How did it feel? What do you think we need to improve for next time, if anything. I'm really fastidious because it's high leverage and easy for me to do. It's like we get that transcribed and captured.
00:57:10 Steve: That is [crosstalk].
00:57:10 Bryan: I was just going to ask you. You have a huddle where people are speaking.
00:57:15 Star: Reviewing.
00:57:16 Bryan: Reviewing, but it's all oral.
00:57:17 Star: All oral and optionally, even interrogating. Tell me, did it seem like [crosstalk].
00:57:24 Bryan: It's conversational.
00:57:25 Star: It's conversational. It's verbal.
00:57:28 Bryan: It's recorded.
00:57:28 Star: It's recorded and then transcribed later. Then that makes it possible to refer to, or search crucially to me and so light enough because you're going to talk about what happened afterward, no matter what. It's a very natural thing for people.
00:57:41 Bryan: We did this. We were raising a lot of money to start a company and the three of us would do this. We would take these oral notes together.
00:57:51 Jessie: Not transcribe them later. That would be interesting.
00:57:53 Bryan: That would be dojo. Bite your tongue. That would dangerous but they were incredibly valuable.
00:58:00 Star: Let's be real. I work with people that are on the record notes and author. Usually, it's just a little thing and actually common.
00:58:07 Bryan: Do you know what's really interesting for that? Is to go back and re-listen to some of that stuff and you're just like, "Oh man. I'd forgotten all these details that were really important details." That was such an interesting experience for us that I have been so tempted to do that, and from an engineering perspective as well. We should just do that. That is such a good idea.
00:58:24 Star: We don't do it all the time. We don't do it for everything but I strive to mitigate the thing where someone is just like, I'm really sure that they said that, this part needs to be heavier. I'm like, "No. They shouldn't be lighter." This way, we don't have to have that debate. We can refer to what was actually said.
00:58:39 Bryan: Back to the tape.
00:58:40 Star: For the critical moments. Then, I think also not having it be audio, is actually a big deal because you can scroll or search or, those [crosstalk].
00:58:47 Bryan: Yes. Having it transcribed. That's a really good idea.
00:58:50 Star: Especially postmortems.
00:58:51 Bryan: Postmortems. There's so many of these design discussions where the other thing that I hate myself for doing, and I've tried to actively undo in myself, but going back and re-listening to some of the stuff. I will have an observation that I want to make, but someone else is speaking. Someone else will say something, and then I will make the observation that I wanted to make.
The reality is, my brain was not processing both of those at the same time, which is a long way of saying, I wasn't listening. You know what I mean? It's like, I was not talking but there was a point that was made.
00:59:28 Steve: You were waiting to talk.
00:59:29 Bryan: Waiting to talk and there was a point that was made that was a valuable point. I would re-listen to it and I know that I've missed the point and you realize how much. Even when you think you're being attentive, the level of attentiveness, you actually have to re-listen to-- I have to listen to the same thing three or four times to really--
00:59:47 Star: Well, maybe that's why you could read instead of re-listening. It's a different channel. I'm saying 9 times out of 10, we don't end up deeply reviewing again but it's there.
00:59:57 Steve: How much audio is it?
00:59:59 Star: Oh, it's a handful of minutes.
01:00:02 Steve: Transcribing it is just, listening and typing that in.
01:00:05 Bryan: You can also use software to do that.
01:00:07 Steve: Do you use software?
01:00:08 Star: Yes.
01:00:09 Jessie: How accurate is that?
01:00:11 Bryan: It's accurate enough.
01:00:12 Jessie: Because I see some weird things on YouTube, that's why I'm saying.
01:00:14 Bryan: For the purposes of what you're talking about, where it's just, I think we need to adjust this control surface or what have you.
01:00:23 Star: I would even argue that it's crucial that we use transcription to get it done, because otherwise it's not high leverage. Otherwise, it's like second per second reliving, no one's got time for that. The only thing I would say is that for a company that touches build process that we own in house, for one thing, there's organizational learning there and for two, I think, capturing SOPs, I can't believe that this is me as an adult, this is what I talk about, capturing the SOP is critical for scaling, end of story. If you can't hand off a process, then what are you doing?
01:00:55 Bryan: Get anything written down and thought about rigorously, and I'm sorry to not be able to move on from the recording of this discussion. I don't feel it's done in the industry. I feel that if we had not done that during the race, I don't know that-- I've seen how incredibly valuable it is, but have you heard of other folks doing this? Maybe this happens--
01:01:00 Star: We get a lot of when we demo, we get a lot of attention because we openly use checklists, and this is even within a field of people doing engineering building stuff, it's like I think it doesn't come naturally.
01:01:25 Jessie: That's interesting, because in light, I feel like checklists are a huge thing before takeoff and landing.
01:01:30 Star: People come from all different backgrounds. It's like a funny thing where there's a high number of pilots on my team and so there's a huge familiarity with the checklist thing is ingrained. Honestly, also how we speak to each other is really informed by the kind of intense radio training you get, radio work.
01:01:45 Bryan: I use niner a lot. Actually, I do use copy and affirmative. [crosstalk] Niner was a joke, but I feel I use affirmative and negative, [crosstalk]
01:02:00 Star: There are some [crosstalk] between I heard you and I'll do it that matter, neither one is a wrong answer to give, but it's like copy.
01:02:08 Bryan: When you hear me say copy this is--
01:02:13 Star: Then the alternative is wilco, which is like will comply. I don't think we really actually say wilco though.
01:02:20 Bryan: You don't say niner, they taught--
01:02:22 Star: I do not say that unless I was really in context where that was appropriate. You can't just niner people.
01:02:34 Bryan: Then also do you Bravo, Delta, Charlie people?
01:02:37 Star: The reason is because radios are bad, in general, they're not these nice podcast microphones you guys have. Radios don't really record what you're saying, or don't really transmit necessarily that well. The culture doesn't depend on the hardware being awesome. It's not just niner, which is the end sound is to differentiate it from something else. Sometimes it's a tree instead of three because the sound gets lost.
01:03:07 Jessie: That's crazy.
01:03:12 Steve: On the Metal is brought to you by Oxide Computer Company. Well, I got to tell you, the podcast has been more successful than I originally anticipated.
01:03:18 Bryan: That's great. This is good news.
01:03:22 Steve: Folks are liking the content. There has been some negative feedback though.
01:03:24 Bryan: For the podcast? The podcast is great. These interviews are amazing.
01:03:30 Steve: The podcasts themselves folks are liking. I've gotten a couple emails specifically calling out the repetitive ad content. Its driving them crazy.
01:03:35 Bryan: We only recorded three ad rolls.
01:03:40 Steve: I know, we get a lot of ad breaks. They were reminding me in email about the fact that there's only been three ad rolls that they've had to hear again and again and again.
01:03:48 Bryan: Oh my God, we're so sorry. It's a great podcast. You don't want to ruin it with repetitive ad rolls.
01:03:48 Steve: Yes. I think it's something we should keep an eye on.
01:03:49 Bryan: Okay. In meantime, we should just tell people to go to oxide.computer, I guess.
01:03:55 Steve: Yes. That's all we need to do.
01:03:55 Bryan: All right. Send it from the request and then we'll shut up. Hey, if you got any feedback on the ads. Definitely send that to us, right?
01:04:03 Steve: Sure. We're getting it.
01:04:02 Bryan: All right. Sounds good. Back to the show.
01:04:08 Bryan: I'm an avid Channel Nine listener from--
01:04:10 Star: Oh my God. Heart eyes.
01:04:14 Bryan: Okay. Channel Nine was the historically-- I did allow you to listen to air traffic study-- [crosstalk] Oh my God. Don't touch the mic. There was a great united ad from the 80s I think where-- I just heard from one of our top customers today and he no longer can be one of our top customers. Have you seen the site, Steve?
01:04:42 Steve: Yes.
01:04:42 Bryan: Where he starts handing out-- It's like, you know what we're going to do we're going to visit all of our customers. He starts calling out names and he's handing out United tickets. Then Rhapsody in Blue is playing. United can abuse me basically, arbitrarily and I'm still a United patriot, which is ridiculous. I love the romance of aviation and I love listening to Channel Nine.
01:05:01 Star: Channel Nine was a way to tune into the air-to-air traffic while flying and listen to other pilots talking to other traffic controllers on the seat like stereo.
01:05:14 Bryan: United 43 have a query for takeoff. One right, do not delay. I love do not delay because in San Francisco that means that there is someone who is actually-- get moving because there is there is someone who is actually landing on the runway.
01:05:31 Star: One fact. SFO has more weather related delays than any other airport in the United States.
01:05:35 Bryan: Absolutely, because the runways are so close together.
01:05:37 Star: The runway separation is not enough to do parallel two runway landing in extreme conditions such as fog which San Francisco might get sometimes.
01:05:44 Bryan: Little bit although I suppose a little bit better, the actual city. San Francisco runways are so close together. They warn you when they are operating under visual conditions. Just letting you know that there's an aircraft next to us. It's normal. This 737 that's next to you that looks like it's about to serve you drinks, that's fine, it's normal. I got so excited I just ripped the cord out of the microphone.
[laughter]
01:06:12 Jessie: I'm enjoying it so much.
01:06:13 Bryan: I know. I get so excited. I just become Iceman.
01:06:17 Star: I love the enthusiasm. It's so wonderful to b on. You guys, you promised to bring On the Metal spirit and here we are, very on the metal.
01:06:26 Bryan: You know what a Tracon is. There's a game called the Tracon.
01:06:31 Star: A game?
01:06:31 Bryan: A game. Tracon is air traffic control. It's what you get handed off to when you travel across the country, and there was a game called then Tracon II which allowed you to be an air traffic controller and then you could dial up all of these scenarios. You do air traffic control on O'Hare approach on a stormy day with a high likelihood of pilots ignoring you because you have a private plane. You have a private plane that you could set a dial where it would not pay attention to what you just told it to do because it's a private pilot.
01:07:05 Star: Sometimes it's a little stressful, these aircraft stimulation games.
01:07:08 Bryan: Oh my God. I was playing this as a 13-year-old and I was going to be like, "I need to pick up a smoking habit just to deal with the stress of playing this game." You see why every air traffic controller-- Anyway.
01:07:21 Star: I'm thinking back to the poor kid listening to this podcast guy who was like, "Don't follow that advice". [laughs]
01:07:27 Bryan: The game I don't think [crosstalk] It was a great game.
01:07:29 Steve: Which one, the circle of batteries or the smoking habit?
01:07:31 Star: There's a litany here.
01:07:33 Jessie: [unintelligible 01:07:32] six-year-old.
01:07:36 Bryan: This stuff is super stressful though.
01:07:38 Star: Magic smoke, any type of smoke, avoid. [laughs]
01:07:43 Bryan: Do you have any Channel Nine stories?
01:07:45 Star: I don't know. Just any time we're able to fly in a big old airplane which was super exciting to me then. I was definitely hooked up to Channel Nine when I could be.
01:07:56 Jessie: I feel like I missed out on a huge portion of my childhood and I'm extremely stressed out about it right now.
01:08:03 Star: Don't be stressed. Don't be stressed.
01:08:05 Bryan: I think it was not popular with pilots. Indeed, the pilots were allowed to start turning it off and on a flight that I desperately wanted to have Channel Nine on because it was a mess. The pilot had turned off Channel Nine.
01:08:17 Jessie: So that people can hear?
01:08:19 Bryan: Yes, you can hear.
01:08:19 Star: Here's the thing. I sometimes deal with aviation adjacent insurance company and their hold music, it's not music. It's actually the live radio air traffic control. Because they know the people are into it. I don't know, you could just record pleasant air traffic control calls. I would take that.
01:08:38 Bryan: Confession. My phone is not in airplane mode when we're taking off because I'm listening to-
01:08:46 Star: That's not good.
01:08:47 Bryan: -KSFO on the plane. You can listen to KSFO. You can get all these live feeds for air traffic control. You can listen to it as you're taking off.
01:08:54 Star: Just to note, you can listen to KSFO in your house on the ground and not in a situation where the regulations are going to pick it up.
[laughter]
01:09:02 Bryan: Does that pose a danger for the aircraft? Is that a well conceived regulation?
01:09:08 Star: Oh, I'm so ready.
01:09:09 Bryan: Yes, it's an unfair question.
01:09:11 Star: Jess, did you want to answer that one?
01:09:15 Jessie: Oh, I don't know.
01:09:15 Steve: Oh.
01:09:17 Star: I can see why they do it. One of the easy could be--
01:09:21 Jessie: Why is it?
01:09:22 Star: What is it?
01:09:23 Steve: There's a rationale behind it that makes sense.
01:09:26 Star: The best way to think about the FAA and honestly FAA regulators have really important job and I think are really trying to do a good job of what they do. You look at the history of aviation, it's the case that pilots were these like yahoo's strapping on a leather skull cap and little goggles and doing rolls or whatever. The FAA's job is to make it to people who don't have any interest in flying or aviation to don't have a worry. The FAA does the worrying. They're outsourced aviation safety worriers. They make sure that like-- aviation is unbelievably sick.
01:10:02 Bryan: It is amazing.
01:10:04 Star: The record is incredible though.
01:10:05 Bryan: I feel NTSB does much for the FAA, right?
01:10:08 Star: These are organizations that work in synchrony, NTSB, National Transportation Safety Board, they investigate any incidents and develop data about what happened and why and how. They create recommendations about how to mitigate those things and FAA enacts the rules, so there's a separation between the organizations but I wouldn't say that--
01:10:28 Bryan: There must be a tension for the NTSB and FAA?
01:10:32 Star: What do you mean?
01:10:32 Bryan: Was it that NTSB made certain recommendations the FAA wouldn't take? They were too expensive to have on, the famous ones being the smoke detectors in the cargo holds.
01:10:40 Star: Well, sure I don't know that specific example but what mean is I think that there's a bi-cameral aspect to it.
01:10:47 Bryan: I love the NTSB.
01:10:50 Jessie: They keep each other in check.
01:10:52 Bryan: They try to, so famously the NTSB felt that smoke detectors were needed in the cargo hold of passenger aircraft and the FAA resisted it because it would have cost like $165 million. It wasn't until the ValuJet crashed which was due to the lack of smoke detectors that the FAA then adopted the regulation. There's tension but it means someone's got to be--.
01:11:13 Jessie: Someone needs to keep the other in check.
01:11:14 Steve: Someone needs to keep the other in check but I love the NTSB.
01:11:16 Star: I'm not sure that they are created to keep each other in check but I do think that they both and especially FAA have hard jobs because you're trying to navigate this risk mitigation and create frameworks to allow other people to safely use it. The fact that we have rules we do is actually pretty great, like you have an idea for an airplane that doesn't look like anything that's ever flown before and you think you can build it. FAA rules actually allow you to build that thing to go fly it, you can't fly over other people.
This is actually really innovation-forward in many ways. You can't take a paying passenger in your hooptie but you can definitely fly yourself around.
01:12:00 Bryan: Yes. On one hand, there was or has been historical tension, but on the other hand, it's like the FAA actually has made modifications and, obviously, a lot of modifications that are trying to balance, it's a hard promise as you say. It's like they're trying to be--
01:12:14 Star: I have a lot of respect for the FAA's job and also the vastness of the United States. It's a federal organization. Any change in rules is enacted across six time zones, at least. It's a huge amount of area that their rules cover. Then also when you look at how strong the aerodynamic aviation bases in the United States, it's like import rules in California end up affecting products across the country because so much is imported through Californian ports. If you make an emission standard for a car, because so many of those cars are going to pass through California, basically, every automaker then just makes cars that comply with California rules. You end up having this huge leverage. It's like you're doing national rule making. Two FAA rules really govern global standards. It's a really serious responsibility.
01:13:05 Bryan: Well, I think it's interesting you phrase it as innovation forward, which is really how we would like to have all regulators be.
01:13:12 Star: Yes. My personal piece on this is I think that I'd like to see a lot more regulation built so that we can do more innovating, if that makes sense. I want a checklist that will allow me to have a place I can go and fly this experiment and do these tasks with my autonomous aircraft. I think that the right thing to do for that is actually to write more standards and it does move slowly. There's a reason for that. The entrepreneur in me, of course, does get frustrated that I can't do certain things. All I can say is, and that is with the caveat, I have an enormous amount of respect for all the work involved.
01:13:52 Bryan: This is an extremely important point I think, that well-structured regulation fosters innovation.
01:13:58 Star: Can, the timescales are rough because you have to have the organizational patience or time to deal with. Yes. Those changes coming slowly. As I mentioned, I've been watching the waves on this for 2009, which is 11 years later. I was like, "Yes, some things have changed." There have been some positive developments but you want to foster innovation. You want to not have these leather cap-wearing yahoos run amuck, but you also do get into trouble when you're favoring organizations through the use of timescales.
01:14:33 Bryan: I love the leather cap-wearing yahoo. I'm sorry. I like giving someone a ride in their hooptie [crosstalk] there's a whole visual here that it's like the barnstormer.
01:14:44 Star: Absolutely. It's been so cool. Now, I'm based in Southern California and Amelia Earhart's home field is really close to where I am. The shadow of the legacy that she created is very present, and so many others.
01:14:59 Bryan: Obviously, its a huge aerospace legacy in SoCal. Is that the part of the reason you guys are down there?
01:15:03 Star: There's still an enormous amount of aerospace activity which is that's really why I'm there is like the people, the talent, the designers, the builders, the fabrication. If you want to tap into that, LA has it.
01:15:14 Jessie: That's cool.
01:15:15 Bryan: Have you read Ben Rich's Skunk Works? Have you read this?
01:15:18 Star: This is a really famous book. It's pretty galvanizing. I'm actually quite close to the former Lockheed Skunk Works plant, which is now a mall but they kept a tribute to the Lockheed plant with-- The mall has-
01:15:35 Bryan: Like a Jamba Juice or something, that's like a Jamba Juice.
01:15:37 Star: Oh, like there's a Target. It's like a whole parking lot. They have cutouts of the Lockheed cutting edge planes like constellation Blackbird that are up on the sign. There's that.
01:15:48 Bryan: On the signs. [crosstalk] You've got-
01:15:51 Star: Kelly Johnson.
01:15:52 Bryan: Kelly Johnson.
01:15:54 Star: He ran the Lockheed Skunk Works which are like turned out these amazing, never seen before, performance aircraft. I think he had a quote, which is, don't just wound your problems, kill them dead. It's really intense.
01:16:07 Bryan: He would love Kelly Johnson. He's an amazing person and goes to Lockheed basically, "Look, I want to do more interesting things. You're going to basically let me do this with the Skunk Works."
01:16:18 Star: He was known for his whip fast mental arithmetic of like some guy was like, "Well, I'm thinking of making like the tube diameter this thing." He's like, "Then the outlet temperature is going to be 600 degrees and how are you going to deal with that?" The guy is reeling in his chair. [laughs]
01:16:32 Bryan: The aircraft they built. They built the U-2.
01:16:35 Star: Just one thing after another that was mind-blowing.
01:16:38 Bryan: Fish Works is a tip of the hat on Skunk Works. Somewhat this is a group I did within Sign which is not doing anything. We were not making the XR 71.
01:16:49 Star: I know you ask the questions, but can you explain like Fish Works. There's a whole NGO going on.
01:16:53 Bryan: Well, so Fish Works is a group that I and a co-worker of mine started to do something similar to Skunk Works, but for computers. The FISH, was fully integrated software and hardware and the works was a tip of the hat.
01:17:05 Star: I thought a Fish was like let's say a hip new shell.
01:17:09 Jessie: I do not use that shell. We're going to get into a whole thing right now.
01:17:14 Bryan: Pull the car over.
01:17:16 Star: She sells seashells down the--
[laughter]
01:17:19 Bryan: Jess, you will love this book. I'll put a link to in the show notes. It's one of those things that it's actually it's been one of the most influential books for me. That is right there with Souvenir Machine in terms of influencing the directory of my life.
01:17:31 Star: Those are totally on the same shelf. It's good. I think if anyone is a super like AV geek or you want to get an aviation geekery another book I really enjoyed reading was called Who Owns the Sky, which has a history of aviation regulation.
01:17:44 Bryan: That sounds good.
01:17:45 Star: It's a short quick book that's better than you'd guess given what the topic is.
01:17:49 Bryan: There's another one, Turbulent Skies which I want to read who owns the sky described. Turbulent Skies is in the Sloan technology series. The whole era of deregulation is amazing.
01:18:01 Star: That's referring to the time where previously airlines would go to the Civil Aeronautics Board and the fares were all set by the federal government so you want to fly from here to there this airline is allowed to do it. This is what that flight will cost.
01:18:15 Jessie: They couldn't compete on price.
01:18:17 Bryan: Oh, no.
01:18:17 Star: Or route.
01:18:18 Bryan: Or route or anything.
01:18:19 Star: Your margin was basically how much better than the fare you could do in operating costs. Then if your company was floundering, you just go to the CAB and just hold out your hat and deregulation was opening up routes and fares to-- this is where we got Southwest and [unintelligible 01:18:34] airlines and everything computerized.
01:18:36 Bryan: People's Express and we've got all sorts of bonkers airlines. There was an explosion of airlines and--
01:18:44 Star: Amazing. Incredible, fantastic book on this topic. It's called Hard Landing.
01:18:51 Bryan: Okay. That's good.
01:18:52 Star: It talks about the downfall of Pan Am that came as a result.
01:18:56 Bryan: Right. Absolutely.
01:18:57 Jessie: Oh shit. Pan Am that was [unintelligible 01:18:57].
01:18:58 Bryan: I remember being with my grandfather in the Pan Am Clipper Club in SFO. Now the United Flight. He was a huge Pan Am flyer, actually, funny in I think 1955, my mother grew up in Saudi Arabia. He was a petroleum engineer. They offered him a lifetime membership to the Clipper Club.
01:19:18 Star: That's really special.
01:19:19 Bryan: For 500 bucks.
01:19:20 Star: Wow, which is a lot of money.
01:19:22 Bryan: Which is a lot of money but my grandfather had this belief that lifetime membership always buy it.
01:19:29 Star: That's really cool.
01:19:30 Bryan: It was definitely.
01:19:33 Star: I read another book early, Sky Gods, which is specifically about Pan Am.
01:19:37 Bryan: About Pan Am.
[01:19:38] Jessie: That's pretty cool.
[crosstalk]
01:19:41 Star: I would rank Sky Gods like it was interesting, but you'd have to really be into it. Hard Landing and Skunk Words were top of my list.
01:19:49 Bryan: As long as you're talking deregulation, I got a deregulation picture book for you. Deregulation Knockouts Vol. one. There is no volume two, which is like a book of photos of defunct airlines.
[01:20:01] Star: What?
01:20:02 Steve: Which is coffee table book.
01:20:04 Bryan: Coffee table book. It is so delightful.
01:20:07 Steve: Conversation starter.
01:20:08 Bryan: Conversation starter. You've got all these crazy airlines that went out of business.
01:20:14 Jessie: They're probably just waiting for more to go defunct for volume two.
01:20:18 Bryan: We're in the post-deregulation era.
01:20:21 Star: I got to take a look at this book.
01:20:23 Bryan: They're great.
01:20:25 Star: I think the history of aviation is really fascinating. There's deregulation. There's also, you look at like the history of different aircraft configurations or good ideas that for whatever reason-- there's a very obscure one called the converter plane that I spent more time than I should admit being interested by which is an aircraft convert from flying an airplane to flying a helicopter. Sorry, to flying like a helicopter but technically--
01:20:50 Bryan: The Osprey did the same thing and famously was a very expensive project that took forever to get right.
01:20:56 Star: Great book about the Osprey. This is called the Dream Machine and there's another book called The Dream Machine which is about J.C.R Licklider and this is not that book.
01:21:08 Bryan: Not that book.
01:21:10 Jessie: Yes, because I was like, "I know a Dream Machine".
01:21:11 Bryan: The dream machine is about the Osprey.
01:21:13 Star: There's two good books with the same title and it really talks about just the amount of commitment of belief the engineers who built the tilt rotors in vital planes had going into that program.
01:21:24 Jessie: That's cool.
01:21:25 Bryan: That program took a long time. [crosstalk]
01:21:28 Star: What people went through, and also the loss of life that that particular aircraft incurred on its way to becoming something we have.
01:21:39 Bryan: Yes, something we have. It's unclear to me how permanently successful that is versus [unintelligible 01:21:45].
01:21:45 Star: I love talking about the future. Who could say?
01:21:48 Bryan: That's right, there you go.
01:21:49 Star: What is permanently successful? In the long run, every computer is [unintelligible 01:21:53].
01:21:53 Bryan: I already hate myself [unintelligible 01:21:54]. No, you're right. You know what actually, I find gutting though is the fact that the A380 has been taken out of service. Isn't that depressing?
01:22:03 Star: Is it?
01:22:03 Bryan: Is it? You're not an A380 fan.
01:22:06 Star: I don't know if I should weigh in.
01:22:07 Jessie: It doesn't mean that new stuff is coming.
01:22:10 Star: I don't dislike the A380 particularly.
01:22:12 Bryan: The A380 has made a bad bet. They bet on hub and spoke.
01:22:15 Star: And huge planes.
01:22:16 Bryan: And huge planes that didn't have any longer range.
01:22:19 Star: I don't know, I take this one step back view about other people's technological developments because things rise and fall and I think it's super interesting. You know what, it's like the creative destruction of like-- This is an interesting idea and it joins many other really interesting ideas in the history of aviation.
01:22:35 Bryan: And now it's in the pantheon of history.
01:22:38 Star: The thing that's impressive is they built it, they shipped it. It exists.
01:22:42 Bryan: It is impressive.
01:22:42 Steve: It flew.
01:22:43 Bryan: It flew. My mother is a long haul traveler and loves that aircraft. It's very upsetting.
01:22:49 Star: A380?
01:22:50 Bryan: A380, yes.
01:22:51 Star: The reason I don't want to weigh in though is there are people who put these hats on. I'm sure you see them in computing all over. "I'm on team Airbus versus team Boeing".
01:23:04 Bryan: I don't know what you're talking about. No, there's no [unintelligible 01:23:05]. No.
01:23:06 Star: What did Jess say about shows. I don't think she has strong feelings.
01:23:09 Jessie: I have strong feelings for sure.
01:23:13 Star: I'm like pro aircraft. [laughs]
01:23:15 Bryan: That's great.
01:23:19 Jessie: Pro moving forward.
01:23:20 Bryan: Why are we so pro in the tribalism of technology.
01:23:22 Jessie: Because you experience the pain of using something else I think. I mean personally, that is where it comes from for me.
01:23:29 Bryan: Interesting. The problem for me is I want to be with people who share my values and I feel like these things divide into values divides at least in computing.
01:23:37 Star: I think it's not wrong to have strong values.
01:23:38 Bryan: Right. It's just too bad that we end up--
01:23:43 Star: The thing that I really like to stay away from is that it's so much easier to tear down a technology and the number of huge airliners that most people have built is much smaller than the number of people who might have opinions about them. We live in this incredible age, there's so much-- I get amazed by little things. Right in front of me on the table right now, there are three bottles. I've got my water bottle that I always have with me. There's a water bottle from a store and then there's--
01:24:15 Bryan: If there's a diet Coke, send me one now.
01:24:19 Star: There's a can of soda.
01:24:20 Bryan: Go ahead, say it. Say it.
01:24:23 Star: Bryan is 90% diet coke.
01:24:26 Bryan: There we go.
01:24:28 Star: All of these vessels are amazing. Forgive me for people who follow my Twitter and read this for some reason still remember but I was just recently tweeting about how incredible it is to have fluid vessels that you can turn upside down and trust they're not going to leak and that the liquid inside is still good. The pioneers of aviation, they didn't have a sports bottle with them in the plane. They were just sweating and thirsty. Maybe this was a small thing but these little things we take for granted are so amazing, much less the big things that we have. I don't know, the world is getting better and it's also an incredible place right now.
01:25:06 Bryan: That is so true.
01:25:06 Jessie: So true. That's so true.
01:25:09 Star: My sickening optimist. [crosstalk]
01:25:11 Bryan: Appreciating that any of this works. Also you're among your people because we just started a computer company which people think is outrageous and hard but it's actually easier to do hardware now than it ever has been and yet, we have got a stronger version to it than ever when we shouldn't. [unintelligible 01:25:30]
01:25:31 Star: Tell me this, because I'm curious about this topic. People are surprised that anyone deals with hardware.
01:25:36 Jessie: Yes. That's also why we have the podcast is also to remind people that this stuff exists.
01:25:41 Bryan: Hardware exists. Hardware exists. [crosstalk]
01:25:42 Jessie: It's crazy because I think that the upper stacks of software got so people heavy. There's so many developers and stuff like that but people tend to forget that there is this underlying component. I don't know.
01:25:57 Star: You're in the Silicon Valley, I think the thing that I'm most surprised by is that we've had for a long time, this management class of people who knew extremely well how to take a budget and convert it into cutting edge, never been seen before hardware on a certain timeline and without massive expenditure. That's a skill you can gain over time.
01:26:19 Bryan: Yes. You can solve hard problems.
01:26:21 Star: It's something we understand reasonably well. I think that the thing that amazes me, and I think that it's been said elsewhere and we don't understand necessarily that well is the conversion of capital into software.
01:26:33 Bryan: I think it requires a great leap into the unknown. There's uncertainty and failures are going to happen and that's very hard for people to wrap their minds around, understandable. As Jess was fond of saying when we were raising money. It's like people want a done deal.
01:26:49 Jessie: They do.
01:26:49 Star: Hardware seemed so much more a done deal to me. This is the thing where I'm just like--
01:26:54 Jessie: Just like a physical object versus software. I don't know, I think it's just the fact that so many people these days just deal in SaaS. It's like software as a service.
01:27:08 Bryan: The thing is and I think it is part of the reason we did the podcast is to communicate to folks that actually, this is more accessible than ever. You've been involved in the open hardware movement. We think that the hardware is easier to make than ever. People can get going on a smaller amount of money than ever. The eight-year-old you can learn about an FPGA.
01:27:31 Star: Yes. Actually, that is really neat, really cool. The resources that are available are incredible. The growth in them is incredible. I say the tools are interesting because they have improved and got more accessible. Also, it's also a world where change comes over time like electronic design tools. It's so adjacent to software and programming tools which just grow explosively. Then I think because maybe programmers are really used to renewing your own tools because if you know how something works, you make your own version of it that works the way you want it to.
We have a theory electrical engineers are so adjacent that there's a belief that this world should be able to also make its own tools, but when it comes to software. I don't know, I feel like a lot of electrical engineering design tools are honestly a bit neglected.
01:28:17 Jessie: They are.
01:28:17 Bryan: Oh, they definitely are. It's where it's the last bastion of tickle. I mean not Tickle Spray.
01:28:23 Star: That was a good deep reference. I had to look blankly at you before it all returned to my mind.
01:28:28 Bryan: You're right. Exactly.
01:28:29 Star: TK. [unintelligible 01:28:31]
01:28:32 Bryan: Right. There you go. Yes.
01:28:34 Star: Yikes. I remember teaching a workshop on how to learn to use an electronic design tool in like 2007. The UI hasn't changed for that tool to this day. I could just give the same spiel and it would--
01:28:47 Bryan: I think change is coming. I think that the EDA has historically been the last bastion of proprietary software, and that's changing. Certainly, we are building stuff on open EDA tools.
01:28:58 Star: There's been a lot of growth there, and that's really good. You're right.
01:29:00 Bryan: The great thing about open source is once something is open, a domain is open, it never goes back. Open-source software is not deleted.
01:29:11 Steve: It could be closed, but not deleted.
01:29:12 Bryan: Well, no, it can't even be closed. You can take a fork is what you can do. You can't actually close it.
01:29:16 Jessie: Then you can change the license, but that which existed is still there.
01:29:19 Bryan: It's still there, and it will exist forever.
01:29:22 Star: I feel like you're talking about rivers.
01:29:26 Bryan: You were hitting on an important point in terms of how much change is actually possible. I think that we lose track of things can be so frustrating in the moment and you're just looking at your experience with autonomous aircraft where the time had to be right. You have to be patient because the world will change. Once it changes, it can change more than you ever thought possible.
01:29:52 Star: This is why I think it's just so great to read the history of technology. I remember reading about the history of development of the helicopter and I think it was in the 1890s, someone wrote a newspaper editorial, which was the flood of credulous capitalists who believe in some sort of chemical-based engine, never ceases, petroleum engines, chemical engines, these people will never get to anything.
01:30:15 Bryan: Oh, my God. That's great [crosstalk]
01:30:16 Star: This was on the verge of the invention of the gas engine and yes, I think it did actually change the world. It came to be but in the moment, it totally didn't look like anything was moving.
01:30:29 Bryan: It's such a great-- I think it's important as technologists that we retain that fundamental, because that is a fundamental optimism that better things are possible. Are you running for president anytime soon?
01:30:43 Star: Are you looking for the thing that will crush me [laughs] my optimism? I don't know how [crosstalk].
01:30:49 Steve: There's a lot of optimizing to be done there though.
01:30:50 Bryan: I take it all back.
01:30:53 Star: I just want to do the small things [laughs].
01:30:56 Steve: Keep doing the small things. I saw one of the projects that you worked on was a single-use drone to deliver in remote parts that would then be biodegradable.
01:31:08 Star: The work I was doing before the current company was we had a few different autonomous aircrafts we shipped. That was for a specific DARPA program where the idea was to have a one-time use bio-degradable aircraft for one-off cargo delivery, that stuff.
01:31:26 Steve: That'd be one of the harder constraints.
01:31:27 Star: It's like it just disappears. Sorry. I know it's not finished because [crosstalk]-
01:31:32 Steve: No, it was described as an exploded cardboard.
01:31:33 Star: -biodegrade but it's just cool. We use cardboard prototyping material. The ultimate material that we explored developing, working with actually with a research lab on it, was lignin, which is like a papery, fabric-y material that had biological seams. You'd activate the fungal spores that would then start to consume the paper fabric material. The awesome thing is when the two different colonies of fungus meet, they basically go to war.
There's this process called hypertrophy where they're like, "You can't have this calorie, we're going to digest it faster." Then the paper lignin would just extremely go to tatters.
01:32:16 Steve: Literally eat itself.
01:32:17 Star: There's a slow growth period and then the colonies meet and then it goes very quickly after that.
01:32:24 Bryan: Oh, that's cool. This is hard enough as it is to actually have a vehicle that will take a payload somewhere and then doing it with all different materials that have to disappear in a certain timeframe. I can't even imagine.
01:32:37 Star: The idea is you do some research. It's not where I like to live, which is like it's a little higher up in the speculative. I like to actually ship things, but we did achieve the mission as described in terms of exploring what was possible and producing a report about something that they-- they have a grading scale for how real technology is, technology readiness levels, TRL levels, a great Wikipedia page, and the idea was to get it to TRL 3 which was what we accomplished. At the same time, on the same team we were simultaneously working on a tethered autonomous helicopter. We were making autonomous aircraft left and right.
